# ToggleGenerator
Generates Toggle Buttons

# Unused Code
Hey this is some code I started developing for a toggle button, however down the line I decided to go with something else since it seemed like a toggle button wasn't the right fit. (you can see the original code in old builds of my calorie calculator project)

This is obviously a strippled down and editable version to generate as many toggles as you'd like in whatever element you want. I'll probably improve it when I do need toggle buttons however im sure someone can still make use of this to get them started.
